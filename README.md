This is a proof-of-concept version of SPIRE that includes support to [Lightweight SVID](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15rfAkzNTQa1ycs-fn9hyIYV5HbznPBsxB-f0vxhNJ24).  
It modifies the FetchJWTSVID endpoint to allow workloads to fetch their LSVID. All other endpoints were kept untouched.  
It is part of the HPE-USP-SPIRE project and is used by all samples in [signed-assertions repository](https://github.com/HPE-USP-SPIRE/signed-assertions).  
It is **not** supposed to be used in production environments without a rigorous code and security review.
