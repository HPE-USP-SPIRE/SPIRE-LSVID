With modifications in workload api to add LSVID support. It is compiling. needs to test the new funcs.


25/10 - 
need to update handler.go to encode b64 the lsvid payload and do the necessary adjs
	// svid, err := h.c.Manager.FetchJWTSVID(ctx, wlSpiffeId, []string{base64.RawURLEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(wlPayload))})

Something is failing, maybe some problem regarding the format that is not jwt


trabalhando no handler, cert2lsr, precisa tirar os dados necessarios do cert pra gerar o LSVID 

the cert2LSVID func in handler needs to be checked. Its outdated, but not being used currently. Bundles is correct?
